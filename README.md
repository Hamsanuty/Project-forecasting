# Project-forecasting
Business owners and managers make use of modern data-gathering techniques to optimize retail delivery of products to the customer base. Forecasting in retail involves utilizing existing data to predict future events and, more specifically, consumer behavior. Existing data and market research varies by the types of products a retailer sells, but the basic means of forecasting in retail follows similar patterns, even across different product lines.  Retail forecasting methods anticipate the future purchasing actions of consumers by evaluating past revenue and consumer behavior over the previous months or year to discern patterns and develop forecasts for the upcoming months. Data is adjusted for seasonal trends, and then a plan for ordering and stocking products may follow the analysis. After fulfillment of current and forthcoming customer purchases and orders, an assessment of the results is compared with previous forecasts, and the entire procedure is repeated.
